<p>I have a synesthesia - I see sound. This is an attempt to describe my visual
field while listening to this song in a darkened room on a very, very
pretentious set of headphones and 100% (ish) sober. The metaphors and similes may
change if I re-write this in the future, but the actual visuals will not. I
highly recommend listening to the song (linked after its title on both YouTube
and Spotify) prior to and during your reading of this post.</p>

<h2 id="paranoid-android---radiohead">Paranoid Android - Radiohead</h2>

<p><a href="https://play.spotify.com/track/0LTZD4vTsp0EN1wXatc9IR">Spotify</a>,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnfXvPBV1dA">YouTube</a></p>

<h3 id="section">0:00 - 0:19</h3>

<p>The song is kicked to life by a raspy washboard sound tearing though my right
ear, not unlike an uncolored extremely fine square wave. Center stage, a few
high guitar tones pluck around, earthen and melancholic. Behind these are some
lower, more loose notes, browner and more squiggly in nature. on the far sides
of the stage (thanks heavy stereo mix) we have some sort of shaken percussion
instrument, a maraca or similar, leaving a linear trail of of EKG-like waves
moving in a very serious fashion. A bass drum kicks a simple beat that is short
and distorts most of the outside edges of my vision, amorphous and not unlike a
raindrop crashing into a still pond. The higher-pitched wood-ish percussion
leaves a small circular shape in it’s wake, and the snare-like thing punctuates
the center stage with bright, white lights that come in and out of existence
rapidly. At about 9.5 seconds, some electric guitar oozes into the mix hard on
the left. It is a shade of ethereal green that fluctuates in luminosity
according to volume, and it’s tone does not seem all that friendly. It looks
like a wobbly bubble, like the type of bubble made from a large wand and very
soapy water, as it struggles to define its place in gravity and life.
(A friend suggested that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sLu-TRYOeI">this</a>
might be apt in describing the video and she was right. The scene is quite
lovely.</p>

<h3 id="section-1">0:19 - 0:45</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please could you stop the noise,</p>

  <p>I’m trying to get some rest From all the</p>

  <p>unborn chicken voices in my head</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thom Yorke’s crystalline voice breaks in a bit low and right as spikes of
quartz and amethyst, the attack of his notes comprising the tips of the crystal
and the notes building the shaft, with the lower frequencies leavingg wider
bodies and the higher frequencies slimmer bodies. The crystals are far, far
brighter and intense than any of the other noises, though the soft guitar
bubbles bubbling into existence provide a lovely contrast to the sharp coldness
of the voice.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What’s that? What’s that?</p>

  <p>(I may be paranoid but i’m not an android)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>moments after Yorke sings “…head”, a metallic twang blips to life far on the
right, a whitish bright light that shoots at you like the reflection from the
noon sun through a spinning prism might hit you, swirling from bottom to top
quite quickly. York’s voice becomes powerful and desperate, an impossibly long
amethyst that has minor cuts and abrasions along its surface that become more
wave-like as the undulations gather in severity (and beauty). “Marvin” the
paranoid android’s computer voice is a mumbled, deep set of square waves
obscured behind Yorke’s voice, completely inhuman, contrasting with the words
he speaks.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I am king, you will be first against the wall</p>

  <p>With your opinion which is of no consequence at all</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are back to the base of the first part of this song. Yorke’s voice goes from
a sort of detached indifference to a sinister judgement, staying in its
crystalline form with the word “all” displaying some of the same imperfect
crystal qualities as seen in the minor chorus. There is quite a bit going on
here, with the percussive lights, little square waves, bubbles, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="section-2">1:39 - 1:58</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>What’s that?
What’s that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Back to the first section’s chorus. The crystal’s of Yorke’s voice are again
impossibly long and intense and the music feels really distant and desolate.</p>

<h3 id="section-3">1:59 - 2:19</h3>

<p>a chimerical bass line drops in to say hello. It evokes an image of a lion
laughing and i have no idea why. It buzzes in a delightful manner, a deep and
not too bright light providing a floor on which the other odd sounds my stand.
Yorke’s odd vocal mumblings are a bit less crystalline and more unnatural.</p>

<h3 id="section-4">2:20 - 2:43</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ambition makes you look pretty ugly</p>

  <p>Kicking and squealing Gucci little piggy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the bass line warps into something sinister blasting out of the left of my
vision. It crescendos on itself, waping from a vespertine grey to a neutral
grey as it rises up. Thom’s weird vocal overdub thing is a worm that bores its
way out of my vision from the bottom.</p>

<h3 id="section-5">2:43 - 2:56</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>You don’t remember You don’t remember Why don’t you remember my name?</p>

  <p>Off with his head, man</p>

  <p>Off with his head, man</p>

  <p>Why don’t you remember my name?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The song really kicks it up here. The crash cymbol and guitar jerk fight for
light, like a rubber band being pulled in three dimensions of chaos. Thom’s
voice morphs from a melancholic moan to furious snarl, lashing out with highly
jagged edges over the delicate backdrop of waves and lighting strickes. The
band join suit with distortion and volume, the guitars registering like
spotlights jumping at your face in the night, bright and white, oscillating in
intensity with their volume. The drum fills are like little bullet holes in a
sheetrock wall, leaking light into the scene at an uneven pace.</p>

<h3 id="section-6">2:57 - 3:06</h3>

<p>I guess Tom’s voice does it’s amazing thing again - its waves flattening out as
tendrils out of vision, only to abruptly switch pace to raise the waves as
snakes might have raised from Medusa’s head. The guitars staircase down, their
distortion still bright and white and angry.</p>

<h3 id="section-7">3:07 - 3:30</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>(guitar solo)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the distortion is ripped from the left and replaced with the brightest busrsts
of lightning from a gun flashing from left to center, contrasting with the
right, a midnight grey base. if you rotated the scene 90 degrees on its axis,
you might get a set of axes for a graph and an ultrafast lightnining storm
for a graph.</p>

<h3 id="section-8">3:30 - 4:06</h3>

<p>The view turns to a hurricane as the instruments are overtaken by a noise
pattern. A crash ends the gales and we see a new scene emerge, with a backdrop
of midnight blue on which the low, reverberating voices dance macabre with the
agonized light of Thom’s voice. Each voice’s octave dropping allows the other
voice to gain dominance, a blanket that shockingly cools you as it hugs your
shoulders. I have piloerections constantly. The there is another synth noise on
the right that looks like the folds from an acordion mid fill, jiggling just a
bit.</p>

<h3 id="section-9">4:07 - 5:08</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rain down, rain down</p>

  <p>Come on rain down on me</p>

  <p>From a great height</p>

  <p>From a great height,height</p>

  <p>Rain down, rain down</p>

  <p>Come on rain down on me</p>

  <p>From a great height</p>

  <p>From a great height, height</p>

  <p>Rain down, rain down</p>

  <p>Come on rain down on me</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The dancing is relegated the the background for a moment, but only to allow the
brilliance that is Thom’s voice to break into stage, radiating its whirling
bits across the stage. There is something depressing and distressing about his
voice and I get a heavy sensation of falling. My mind flashes to scenes of
desolate man sinking in a body of still water, forgotten by the world, soon to
hit the bottom and rest for eternity.</p>

<h3 id="section-10">5:09 - 5:41</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>That’s it, sir</p>

  <p>You’re leaving</p>

  <p>The crackle of pigskin</p>

  <p>The dust and the screaming</p>

  <p>The yuppies networking</p>

  <p>The panic, the vomit The panic, the vomit</p>

  <p>God loves his children, God loves his children, yeah!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The previous scene continues, the dance in full climax here, the voices
overwhelming in their takeover of my vision, the bulletholes from the snare
breaking through with their slivers of light.</p>

<h3 id="end">5:42 - 6:24 (end)</h3>

<p>The dance is cleared and the stage destroyed, ambushed by that chimerical
little bass from earlier and his enraged friends. The bullets become rockets
when the crash is crashed and the guitar’s lightning bolts spiral around the
stage, Emperor Palpatine relentlessly assaulting Luke in the Death Star. Sorry
for the Star Wars analogy, but it’s appropriate here. The warped voices,
screams and growls and snarls, seem right for the scene.</p>
